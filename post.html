                There is a blueprint hidden in plain sight. This is the argument for why
                New York's greatest era hasn't happened yet&mdash;and how a handful of
                obsessed citizens could make it inevitable.

                    Everyone who has ever fallen in love with New York City has had the same thought,
                    usually around 1 AM, usually alone, usually after a particularly good or particularly
                    terrible day: <em>this place could be so much more.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not that the city is bad. It is, by most measures, the most extraordinary
                    concentration of human talent, ambition, and infrastructure on the planet. More
                    happens per square mile in Manhattan on a slow Tuesday than happens in most cities
                    in a year. The density is the point. The chaos is the point. The relentless,
                    grinding, beautiful machinery of eight million overlapping lives is the point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But there's a gap&mdash;a vast, yawning gap&mdash;between what New York <em>is</em>
                    and what it <em>could be</em>. And that gap isn't an accident. It's architectural.
                    It was designed, piece by piece, law by law, veto by veto, over the course of
                    decades. The city's constraints are not natural. They are <em>chosen</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Which means they can be <em>unchosen</em>.

                    The rest of this piece lays out the specific mechanisms&mdash;the social technologies,
                    the political levers, the cultural shifts&mdash;that could unlock New York's next
                    golden age. It draws on two years of research into the city's governance, interviews
                    with people who've actually moved the needle, and a healthy dose of informed optimism.
